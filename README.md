# Minimint

**This is an experimental implementation of a federated Chaumian bank. DO NOT USE IT WITH REAL MONEY, THERE ARE MULTIPLE KNOWN SECURITY ISSUES.**

## Running MiniMint locally
MiniMint is tested and developed using rust `stable`, you can get it through your package manager or from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### Generating config
You first need to generate some config. All scripts assume config to be located in a folder called `cfg`. Then you can generate the necessary configuration files as follows:

```shell
mkdir -p cfg
cargo run --example configgen cfg <num_nodes> 5000 6000 <tier1> <tier2> …
```

`<num_nodes>` is the amount of nodes the federation shall consist of. It should be >=4 (I always test with 5) and not too big as the cryptography of the BFT protocol is rather intense and you should ideally have 1 core per node. The numbers `5000` and `6000` specify the beginning of the port range the inner-federation sockets and API sockets bind to. The remaining arguments will be interpreted as amount tiers in msat.

This will both create all the `server-n.json` config files and one `client.json`. If you want to play with multiple clients you should create ons subdirectory per client and copy the `client.json` into each.

### Running the mints
A script for running all mints and a regtest `bitcoind` at once is provided at `scripts/startfed.sh`. Run it as follows:

```shell
bash scripts/startfed.sh <num_nodes> 0
```

The `0` in the end specifies how many nodes to leave out. E.g. changing it to one would skip the first node. This is useful to run a single node with a debugger attached.

Log output can be adjusted using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable and is set to `info` by default. Logging can be adjusted per module, see the [`env_logger` documentation](https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.8.4/env_logger/#enabling-logging) for details.

### Using the client
First you need to make sure that your regtest `bitcoind` has some coins that are mature. For that you can generate a few hundred blocks to your own wallet:

```shell
ADDRESS="$(bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=bitcoin -rpcpassword=bitcoin getnewaddress)"
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=bitcoin -rpcpassword=bitcoin generatetoaddress 200 "$ADDRESS"
```

Then you can use the peg-in script to deposit funds. It contains comments that explain the deposit process.

```shell
bash scripts/pegin.sh <amount in BTC>
```

Take care to not request too big of a peg-in (depending on your amount tier the smallest representations as tokens might be too big to finish signing in reasonable time) or too small (there is a 500sat fee that needs to be paid). After about 20s your default client in `cfg` should have newly issued coins.

You can view your client's holdings using the `info` command:

```
minimint $ cargo run --bin mint-client --release -- cfg info
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.11s
     Running `target/release/mint-client cfg info`
Jun 15 14:57:22.066  INFO mint_client: We own 14 coins with a total value of 9500000 msat
Jun 15 14:57:22.066  INFO mint_client: We own 5 coins of denomination 100000 msat
Jun 15 14:57:22.066  INFO mint_client: We own 9 coins of denomination 1000000 msat
```

The `spend` subcommand allows to send tokens to another client. This will select the smallest possible set of the client's coins that represents a given amount. The coins are base64 encoded and printed to stdout.

```
minimint $ cargo run --bin mint-client --release -- cfg spend 400000
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.12s
     Running `target/release/mint-client cfg spend 400000`

```

A receiving client can now reissue these coins to claim them and avoid double spends:

```
minimint $ cargo run --bin mint-client --release -- cfg reissue AQAAAAAAAACghgE…
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.13s
     Running `target/release/mint-client cfg reissue AQAAAAAAAACghgE…

minimint $ cargo run --bin mint-client --release -- cfg fetch

```

There also exist some other, more experimental commands that can be explored using the `--help` flag:

```
minimint $ cargo run --bin mint-client --release -- --help
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.12s
     Running `target/release/mint-client --help`
